   library.AddUser(user1);
   ```

2. Add an author:
   ```csharp
   Author author1 = new Author(library.NextAuthorId(), "Jan", "Kowalski");
   library.AddAuthor(author1);
   ```

3. Add a book:
   ```csharp
   Book book1 = new Book(library.NextBookId(), "C# For Beginners", author1, false, null);
   library.AddBook(book1);
   ```
